### v0.3.0
January 8, 2021

The primary objective of this release is to make it easier to interact with Domo via Python and to sync functionality with the R SDK. The following changes have been made.
* Methods were added to the primary object so that the sub-objects don't need to be used.
* Method names sync'd with functions from the R SDK
* Method names follow a specific naming convention for ease of use
* Methods to download data from Domo now return a Pandas dataframe
* Methods to upload data to Domo now take a Pandas dataframe as an input
* Uploading data is now easier as interactions with the streams API are abstracted
* All methods prior to these updates are unchanged, existing code should continue to work w/o issue
